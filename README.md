# Image classification using SL algorithms

This project aims to compare various supervised learning models when applied to 
image classification. Our [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tongpython/cat-and-dog) consists of images of cats and dogs and is available of Kaggle.
Models used include K-Nearest Neighbors, Artificial Neural Networks, and Convolutional Neural Networks.

## KNN

K-Nearest Neighbors is a non-learning based algorithms which aims to predict a label for a given data vector using its distance between its K nearest neighbors.
Various values of K were used such as 3, 5, 7, and 9 and their accuracies compared, the results are as follows:
